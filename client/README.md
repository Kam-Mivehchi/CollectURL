# Bucket List 

## User Story
As I user I want to be able to create a List of Websites,
When I add a URL to a list, a styled card is automatically generated using meta dat from the submitted site,
When I save the list item I see it in the respective list and it saves to local storage, 
When I want to add another list, I am prompted to sign in or create an account,
when I succesfully sign in, that list is saved to a 'General Bucket',
Then I am presented with a library view of all my buckets with the general bucket highlighted at the top;
When I click the '+' button I am presented with a modal that asks which bucket I want to use or create new bucket and the title of the list.
When that form is submitted the newly created list will open up in single page mode.
When i click the color pallete in the navabar I can change the theme of the sight.
When I click explore I see other peoples lists
